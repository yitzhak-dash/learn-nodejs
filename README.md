## First-class function and function expression:
## Module (`require(...)`, `module.exports = ...`)
## Object as collection of Name/value pairs.
## Prototypal Inheritance.
## (4-06)By Reference and Value.
## (4-07)Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE)
## (4-11) Module patterns -> the most popular *Revealing module pattern*.
## (6-1) *Javascript* is synchronous - only one line of code executing at a time. *NodeJS* is asynchronous
## Binary data ->  0 1 0 1 = (2^3 * 0) +(2^2 * 1) + (2^1 * 0) + (2^0 * 1)   = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
## Characters sets : a representation of  a characters as numbers (Unicode, ascii)
## Characters encoding : how the characters are storing in binary.
## Pipe: connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.
## Protocol: a set of rules two side agree on to use when communicating.
## TCP/IP - the HTTP, FTP and other protocols define structure of a sending data, the TCP defines how the data will be send.
## Use streams whatever you can.
## Semantic Versioning: ([semver.org](semver.org)) version number structure -> major.minor.patch (1.7.3):
- patch number increment if *some bugs were fixed, code will work fine*
- minor number was updated if *some new features were added, code will work fine.*
- major changed *Big changes, code will break(maybe)*
## use `npm init` to create package.json file
## use `npm install <package_name> --save-dev` to install development dependencies.
## use `npm update` to update dependencies.
## use `npm install nodemon -g` to watch changes
## middleware: code that sits between two layers of software(in express between request and response).
## static files: not processed by code in any way, for example: CSS, HTML...
